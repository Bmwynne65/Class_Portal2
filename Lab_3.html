                The Kardashev scale (Russian: Шкала Кардашева, romanized: Shkala Kardasheva) is a method of measuring a civilization's level of technological advancement based on the amount of energy it is capable of using. The measure was proposed by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev (1932–2019)[1] in 1964[2] and was named after him.

                The scale is hypothetical, and refers to energy consumption on a cosmic scale. Various extensions of the scale have since been proposed, including a wider range of power levels (Types 0, IV to V) and the use of metrics other than pure power (e.g., knowledge economy or resource mastery).[3][4]

                Kardashev first outlined his scale in a paper presented at the 1964 Byurakan conference in Armenia, a scientific meeting that reviewed the Soviet radio astronomy space listening program. The paper, titled "Передача информации внеземными цивилизациями" ("Transmission of Information by Extraterrestrial Civilizations").[2] Starting from a functional definition of civilization, based on the immutability of physical laws and using human civilization as a model of extrapolation, Kardashev's initial model was developed. He proposed a classification of civilizations into three types, based on the axiom of exponential growth:

            </p>
            <p>
                A Type I civilization is able to access all the energy available on its planet and store it for consumption. Hypothetically, they should also be able to control natural events such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, etc.
                A Type II civilization can directly consume a star's energy, most likely through the use of a Dyson sphere.
                A Type III civilization is able to capture all the energy emitted by its galaxy, and every object within it, such as every star, black hole, etc.
            </p>

            <p>
                n a second article, entitled "Strategies of Searching for Extraterrestrial Intelligence", published in 1980, Kardashev wonders about the ability of a civilization, which he defines by its ability to access energy, to sustain itself, and to integrate information from its environment.[5] Two more articles followed: "On the Inevitability and the Possible Structure of Super Civilizations" and "Cosmology and Civilizations", published in 1985 and 1997, respectively;[6][7] the Soviet astronomer proposed ways to detect super civilizations and to direct the SETI (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) programs.

                Several scientists have conducted various searches for possible civilizations, but with no conclusive results.[8] However, based on these criteria, unusual objects, now known to be either pulsars or quasars, were identified.[9]

            <p>
                Kardashev presented for the first time a classification of civilizations according to their level of energy consumption in an article entitled Transmission of Information by Extraterrestrial Civilizations, published in 1964 first in Russian in the March-April issue of the Astronomicheskii Zhurnal,[2] then in English in the September–October 1964 issue of the Soviet Astronomical Journal.[2] In this article, the scientist presents a calculation of the evolution of the energy needs of humanity, and calculates that the energy consumption of the latter will be equal to that emitted by the Sun, evaluated at 4 × 1026 watts (W), in about 3,200 years, then will be equal to that emitted by 1011 stars similar to ours (which corresponds to the estimated number of stars in the Milky Way) in 5,800 years. Based on this observation, and considering that there is no reason to assume that the evolution of humanity's energy consumption can decrease, Kardashev comes to propose a classification of technological civilizations into three types.[2][10]

                A civilization known as "Type I" is able to collect and use all the available energy on its planet, that is, the theoretical equivalent of 1016 watts. According to Kardashev, it is the type of civilization that Earth was closest to achieving in 1964. A civilization known as "Type II" would surpass the first by a factor of 10 billion, reaching a consumption of 1026 watts, this time using all the power emitted by its star. Finally, a civilization known as "Type III" would be able to collect and consume all the energy emitted by its galaxy, which is equivalent to 1037 watts.[2]

                Assuming the development of radio, Kardashev predicted that in the following two decades (i.e. in the 1980s) it would be possible to build antennas of 100,000 m2 capable of detecting Type II and III civilizations. A Type I civilization like that of earth would be able to receive the extraordinary energetic emissions of the other types of civilizations, which would supposedly be able to emit continuously.[2][11]

                Kardashev then examined the characteristics of a transmission from an artificial source. He mentioned in particular the two cosmic radio sources discovered in 1963 by the California Institute of Technology, CTA-21 and CTA-102 in particular, which would have characteristics close to those of a presumed artificial source. The most suitable region of the galaxy for observing Type II and III civilizations would then be the Galactic Center, due to the high density of the stellar population it harbors. He then recommended that the search programs for such artificial sources should focus on other nearby galaxies, such as the Andromeda Galaxy, the Magellanic Clouds, M87, or Centaurus A. Kardashev concluded his paper by noting that the possible discovery of even the simplest organisms on Mars would increase the likelihood that Type II civilizations exist in the galaxy.[2]
