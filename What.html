            <h1>What is Accessibility?</h1>
            <p>Accessibility refers to the design and implementation of products, services, environments, and digital content in a way that ensures they can be easily used and accessed by individuals with disabilities. The goal of accessibility is to create inclusive experiences for everyone, regardless of their physical or cognitive abilities.

                In the context of digital technology, web accessibility is a crucial aspect. It involves designing websites, applications, and other digital tools in a way that allows people with disabilities to perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the content effectively. This includes considerations for individuals with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments.
                
                Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provide a set of guidelines and standards to help developers and designers create accessible digital content. These guidelines cover various aspects such as providing text alternatives for non-text content, designing navigable and readable interfaces, ensuring compatibility with assistive technologies, and more.
                
                In summary, accessibility aims to break down barriers and make sure that everyone, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, can fully participate in and benefit from all aspects of society, including technology and digital communication.
